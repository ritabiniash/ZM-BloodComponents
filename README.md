# Zichron Menachem Blood Components App

## The Need

Thousands of Israelis need platelet donations to survive and fight cancer,
chronic diseases, or traumatic injuries.

Platelets are colorless cell fragments called thrombocytes. Their main function
is to stick to the lining of blood vessels and stop bleeding.

The process of clotting begins if one of your blood vessels gets damaged. The
vessel sends out signals that are picked up by platelets. The platelets then
rush to the site of damage and form a plug, or clot, to repair the damage.

Many lifesaving medical treatments for patients require platelet transfusions:
Cancer patients, those receiving organ or bone marrow transplants, victims of
traumatic injuries, and patients undergoing open heart surgery. Platelets must
be transfused within just 5 days after donation - so there is a constant, often
critical need for new and current donors to give to keep up with hospital
demand.

## The Apps

Zichron Menachem volunteers are in touch with hundreds of potential platelet donors daily,
and help to coordinate between them, and the hospitals where the donation machines are located.

These 2 apps were created in order to help them with this sacred task:

- `ZM-Coordinator` app lets the coordinators add available appointments and monitor new bookings.
- `ZM-Donor` app lets the donors see all available appointments and easily sign up to a donation.
